vagrant-base
============

A starting point for projects for using vagrant

This installs mysql (username/password: root), apache, a share folder, and sets the ip of the instance to 192.168.56.101

First, run: vagrant box add http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box

now you can run vagrant up and you project will be started.
